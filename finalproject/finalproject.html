            <h1>Final Project!</h1>
            <p>This page will document my progress as as ideate and prototype my final project for HCDE 439.</p>
            <p>2/2 - I'm trying to get a MIDI input circuit working with a drum machine.</p>
            <p>I have moved my A4 to a solderable breadboard to create a first prototype for the final project. </br> I have also ordered rigid channels to put my WS2812b RGB LED strips into.</p>

            <p>2/14 - Got the drum machine working with LED strip. Enclosure arriving tomorrow for first 'nice' prototype.</p>
            <p>This video shows the LEDs responding to drum machine MIDI messages. The LEDs are in plastic enclosures.</p>
