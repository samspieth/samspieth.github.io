            <h1>Final Project!</h1>
            <p>This page will document my progress as I create my final project for HCDE 439.</p>
            <p>2/2 - I'm trying to get a MIDI input circuit working with a drum machine.</br>
            2/12 - I have moved my A4 to a solderable breadboard to create a first prototype for the final project. </br>
            I have also ordered aluminum channels to put my WS2812b RGB LED strips into.</p>
            <p><img src="439FinalPrototype1.jpg" width=400></p>
            <p>2/14 - Drum machine controlling LED strip. Enclosure arriving tomorrow to make nicer looking LED strips.</p>
            <p>This video shows the LEDs responding to drum machine MIDI messages.
            Here, the LEDs are placed temporarily in the aluminum enclosures.</p>

       		<p>2/20 - These are the LED connectors I will be attaching to the ends of the cut strips to connect my 3 segments.</br>
       		They comprise of 3 wires (power, ground, and data), and a male or female 3-pin connector. My LED segments will each</br>
       		have a male and female connector, except the end segment will only have a female connector.</p>
       		<p><img src="led_connectors.JPG" width=400></p>
       		<p>2/22 - I cut and soldered the LED strips to place in the enclosures. The WS2812b LED strip I'm using has 60 leds/meter,</br>
       		and the enclosures are 1 meter each. So, there are 60 LEDs on each of the strips I cut.</p>
       		<p><img src="soldered_leds.JPG" width=400></p>
       		<p>2/23 - These are the 3 strips I made. After cutting and soldering the LED strips, they were glued down into the</br>
       		enclosures. Then the plastic diffusing cover was place on top of the LEDs. The enclosure end caps, which were placed onto the </br>
			LED strip connectors before they were soldered to the LEDs, were glued into place in the enclosures.</p>
			<p><img src="strips_completed.JPG" width=400></p>
			<p>And this is what they look like lit up.</p>

       		<p>3/2 - This is an Arduino Mega with the CQRobot DMX Shield and the Spectrum Shield on top of it. </br>
       		The DMX Shield allows the control of standard stage lighting devices - DMX is the industry standard </br>
       		communication protocol. However, this shield generated weak DMX data that could not power more than 1 light, </br>
       		and I have 2 DMX lights (so far).</p>
       		<p><img src="cqshield.JPG" width=400></p>
       		<p>These are the DMX lights I am controlling with the Arduino - image from Amazon</br>(https://www.amazon.com/Lixada-Lighting-Professional-Channels-100-240V/dp/B01DXK33FC)</p>
       		<p><img src="dmxFromAmazon.jpg" width=400></p>
       		<p>3/5 - Luckily, I was able to get another DMX shield, from Tinkerkit, that solved the issue. </br>
       		This one didn't come with the DMX connectors attached - I soldered wires to a panel-mount connector, and the </br>
       		wires are screwed into screw terminals on the "OUT" side of the DMX shield.</p>
       		<p><img src="tinker_connections.JPG" width=400></p>
       		<p>3/6 - Finally, all the pieces are in the box. The mounted jacks are: DMX out jack (control spotlights), </br>
       		MIDI in (receive drum machine data), and DC power. Also coming out of holes in the enclosure are a USB cord </br>
       		connected to one of the Arduinos, 3 wires to control the LED strips, and a 1/8" audio cable connected to the</br>
       		spectrum shield. The spectrum shield is connected to one of the outputs of my audio interface, and analyzes the</br>
       		different frequencies of an audio signal. Currently, the low frequencies are used to control the brightness of the DMX lights.</p>

			<p>After smushing some wires down, the box was finally able to be closed.</p>
			<p><img src="box_closed.JPG" width=400></p>
			<p>Here is a simple video of the project functioning. MIDI data from the drum machine/synthesizer, which is </br>
			creating all the audio heard in the video, controls the LED lights. The DMX lights are programmed to move in time </br>
			with the MIDI beat and their brightness is controlled by the level of the low audio frequencies.</p>
