            <h1>Final Project!</h1>
            <p>This page will document my progress as as ideate and prototype my final project for HCDE 439.</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm trying to get a MIDI input circuit working with a drum machine - it's not going well. </br></p>
            <p>I have moved my A4 to a solderable breadboard to create a first prototype for the final project. </br> I have also ordered rigid channels to put my WS2812b RGB LED strips into.</p>

            <p> In this A4 video, the Arduino controlling the LEDs freezes when the entire strip is turned on. I figured out that this was because </br> I was running 5V power into the VIN pin, which requires 7-12V to regulate down to 5. </br> Connecting power to the 5V pin directly works but introduces the risk of plugging in too high voltage power supply.</p>
