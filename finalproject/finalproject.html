            <h1>Final Project!</h1>
            <p>This page will document my progress as I create my final project for HCDE 439.</p>
            <p>2/2 - I'm trying to get a MIDI input circuit working with a drum machine.</br>
            2/12 - I have moved my A4 to a solderable breadboard to create a first prototype for the final project. </br>
            I have also ordered aluminum channels to put my WS2812b RGB LED strips into.</p>

            <p>2/14 - Drum machine controlling LED strip. Enclosure arriving tomorrow to make nicer looking LED strips.</p>
            <p>This video shows the LEDs responding to drum machine MIDI messages.
            Here, the LEDs are placed temporarily in the aluminum enclosures.</p>

       		<p>2/20 - These are the LED connectors I will be attaching to the ends of the cut strips to connect my 3 segments.</br>
       		They comprise of 3 wires (power, ground, and data), and a male or female 3-pin connector. My LED segments will each</br>
       		have a male and female connector, except the end segment will only have a female connector.</p>
       		<p><img src="led_connectors.jpg" width=400></p>
       		<p>2/22 - I cut and soldered the LED strips to place in the enclosures. The WS2812b LED strip I'm using has 60 leds/meter,</br>
       		and the enclosures are 1 meter each. So, there are 60 LEDs on each of the strips I cut.</p>
       		<p><img src="soldered_leds.jpg" width=400></p>
       		<p>2/23 - These are the 3 strips I made. After cutting and soldering the LED strips, they were glued down into the</br>
       		enclosures. Then the plastic diffusing cover was place on top of the LEDs. The enclosure end caps, which were placed onto the </br>
			LED strip connectors before they were soldered to the LEDs, were glued into place in the enclosures.</p>

			<p>And this is what they look like lit up.</p>
