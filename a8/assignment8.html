            <p>Assignment: Solder something.</p>
            <p>This is a segment of the LED strips I am working with for my final project. These strips can be cut and soldered </br> to connectors to create custom shapes and lengths. For my project, I have created 3 1-meter lengths, which have been </br>soldered to connectors and encased in aluminum diffusing enclosures.

            <p>This is the first soldered prototype of final project<br> This circuit is very similar to my circuit for A4 but has been transferred to a solderable breadboard. </br> This iteration is no longer in use because it shorted out somehow and some of the power and ground wires melted together. Stinky. </p>

            <p>This is the back of the above prototype.</p>
